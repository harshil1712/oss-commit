Track your open-source contributions
</p>

2022 is about to begin, and most of us have already started planning our goals. OSS Commit is a project to help you achieve your open-source contribution goals.

## How does it work?
1. Create a [new issue](https://github.com/harshil1712/oss-commit/issues/new?assignees=&labels=goals&template=commit.yml&title=%5BCommit%5D+).
2. Share your contribution goals by completing the issue template.

**Note:** Don't remove `[Commit]` from the Issue title.

3. At the end of each month, we will share your contribution stats and help you know your progress.

## FAQ

### Who can participate?
OSS commit is for all. Your experience doesn't matter. All that matters is your passion.

### Why are you building OSS Commit?
Every year we make resolutions and set goals for ourselves. We create them for both professional and personal growth. OSS Commit allows you to set your open source contribution goals, track your progress, and help you achieve them.

### How do these numbers qualify as impact metrics?
The goal of the project is to encourage the community to set goals and contribute to open-source. The metrics definitely **don't** talk about the impact one is making in open-source. However, they help in keeping track of your progress and motivate you.

### Do we get swags on successful completion?
Everyone loves swags, I do too! OSS commit is currently not sponsored by any organization and is run independently by me. Hence, there are no swags for now. Saying that, if we get sponsors, we might have something for you all ;)

### How can I know my 2021 contribution stats?
Earlier in December, I launched [GitHub Wrap](https://lowcode.land/ghwrap/)! Use this to learn about your open-source contributions.

### How was OSS Commit built?
OSS Commit is built using [n8n](https://n8n.io?utm=ref_oss_commit_harshil), [Supabase](https://supabase.com), and [GitHub](https://github.com), with a little procrastination and a lot of love.

### I've more questions. Where can I reach out?
You can always DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harshil1712) or open a new Discussion topic.

### I love your work. How can I support you?
I am glad that you enjoy my work. You can [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/harshil1712) me on GitHub to keep me get going!
